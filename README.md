# AutoCSP

![](https://api.travis-ci.org/fcsonline/autocsp.svg)

AutoCSP is not just another tool to generate a valid Content Security Policy header
for your current webpage. Also is a didactic tool to understand all the
available ways to increase the security of your web page.

With AutoCSP you can generate:

- Content-Security-Policy headers
- Nonce references
- Subresource integrity hashes
- Inline script hashes

### How it works

Basically, it analizes your DOM tags looking for sources for all the rules:

- **default-src:**
- **script-src:**
- **style-src:**
- **img-src:**
- **child-src:**
- **media-src:**
- **object-src:**

Not supported yet:

- **font-src:**
- **connect-src:**

### How to use it

Go to you webpage, open the browser inspector and include the minified version
of this library in your DOM manually.

```html
<script src="http://cdn..../autocsp.min.js"></script>
```

If your are using jQuery in your webpage you can run this:

```javascript
$.getScript("http://cdn..../autocsp.min.js");
```

After load this library in your webpage context, then you can start to analyze
your webpage. Run the code below:

```javascript
AutoCSP.rule();
```
and you will get a console output like this:

```
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'; script-src 'self' www.google-analytics.co www.googletagmanager.co i.kissmetrics.co cdn.ravenjs.co 'sha256-faDewrRjLN6HVr4qFb34mLsJTMWzibMGtolRQsuqEB0=' 'sha256-Dvu64ENYzDEkDpriV+KtNqfahz95IoNI4db+QIp9F+g='; style-src 'self' fonts.googleapis.co; img-src 'self' secure.gravatar.co; child-src 'none'; font-src 'self'; connect-src 'self'; media-src 'none'; object-src 'none';
```

**Note:** It's important to understand that this should not be the common flow to create
this header for your web page. When you start creating a webpage, you need to
control all the orgins where you resquest from, instead of generate them
afterwards. However, for projects that have not controlled their source origins
in the past, this tool could be useful to spot them.

By default, AutoCSP generates all the hashes with `sha256` algorithm but you
can change it to one of the availble ones:

- sha1
- sha256 * Default
- sha384
- sha512

Example:
```javascript
AutoCSP.setup('sha384');
```

CSP Level 2 added backward compatibility for inline scripts by allowing you to
whitelist specific inline scripts using either a cryptographic nonce (number
used once) or a hash. As we said before, with AutoCSP you can get all current
hashes:

```javascript
AutoCSP.hashes();
```

If your are loading third-party JavaScript and you want to prevent unexpected
or malicious modifications, we recomend to you add [Subresource
Integrity](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/09/subresource-integrity-in-firefox-43/)
checks to all your script tags.

With this feature you can be sure that your webpage will not be compromised if
one ore more scripts in your Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) get modified
without authorization.

```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/underscore.js/1.8.3/underscore-min.js" integrity="sha384-FZY+KSLVXVyc1qAlqH9oCx1JEOlQh6iXfw3o2n3Iy32qGjXmUPWT9I0Z9e9wxYe3" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

In this example, we are inclouding [Underscore library](http://underscorejs.org/),
from CloudFlare CDN and we can be sure that we are loading the code that we
trust and match with
`sha384-FZY+KSLVXVyc1qAlqH9oCx1JEOlQh6iXfw3o2n3Iy32qGjXmUPWT9I0Z9e9wxYe3` hash.

In AutoCSP you can generate all Subresource Integrity hashes for your third
party scripts all at the same time. Just run:

```javascript
AutoCSP.integrities();
```

### TODO

- Tests
- Detect font-src urls: we need to parse css to retreive them
- Detect connect urls: we need to analyze XHR traffic
